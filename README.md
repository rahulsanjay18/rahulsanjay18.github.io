## Welcome to my Github!

Hello, my name is Rahul Shah, and I am currently a student of Computer Engineering at Penn State University.

Here is my resume

And here is a list of my various projects (in semi-chronological order of start date)!

* Calculator: Made to try to emulate the functionality of a TI-89 (at the very least, the functions that I or any college student would use)
* Space-Shooter-FBLA: Yet another competition, this time a game made in Unity. This game, oddly enough, does have many bugs, but the game that I ended up submitting was checked for bugs, and I have no idea where the bug free version of the game is.
* Minute Math v2: An extension on the first version, implementing a level for trigonometry and a better system to evaluate all equations
* Minute Math v1: For the Congressional App Challenge I made a desktop application that tests you on how fast a person can do fast mathematics
* CheckersCMDln: A (mostly) working checkers game that works in the command line
* Cortex: Created for a competition, where I used JavaFx to create a Desktop Application. Cannot show the code, because I ended up wining the competition (7th in nation). Sorry!
* arduinoCalculator: A four function arduino calculator. Made for a project I did in TinkerCAD. Was mostly to explore the arduino a little.
* Trivia Game: an iOS project I did in tenth grade as my final project

### Future project ideas:

* None yet.
