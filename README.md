## Welcome to my Github!

Hello, my name is Rahul Shah, and I am currently a student of Computer Engineering/Mathematics at Penn State University.

And here is a list of my various projects (in semi-chronological order of start date)! Some of the READMEs that need to be updated are not. Some of the older projects will not have updated READMEs. Some projects are not listed here as they aren't really projects per se, more just programming practice.

* [Audible Graph](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/AudibleGraph): A little science experiment I thought up, to try to hear graphs. It basically generates an audio file via java standard audio (using code created by professors in princeton) that shows what a polynomial "sounds" like.

* [3dGraph](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/3dGraph): An attempt at creating holograms for the sake of visualizing graphs of 2 variables.

* [Calculator](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/Calculator/): Made to try to emulate the functionality of a TI-89 (at the very least, the functions that I or any college student would use)

* [Space-Shooter-FBLA](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/Space-Shooter-FBLA): Yet another competition, this time a game made in Unity. This game, oddly enough, does have many bugs, but the game that I ended up submitting was checked for bugs, and I have no idea where the bug free version of the game is.

* [Minute Math v2](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/MinuteMathGame): An extension on the first version, implementing a level for trigonometry and a better system to evaluate all equations

* [Minute Math v1](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/Minute-Math): For the Congressional App Challenge I made a desktop application that tests you on how fast a person can do fast mathematics

* [CheckersCMDln](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/CheckersCMDln): A (mostly) working checkers game that works in the command line

* Cortex: Created for a competition, where I used JavaFx to create a Desktop Application. Cannot show the code, because I ended up wining the competition (7th in nation). Sorry!

* [arduinoCalculator](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/arduinoCalculator): A four function arduino calculator. Made for a project I did in TinkerCAD. Was mostly to explore the arduino a little.

* [Trivia Game](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/triviaGame): an iOS project I did in tenth grade as my final project
