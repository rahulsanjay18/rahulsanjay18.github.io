## Welcome to my Github!

Hello, my name is Rahul Shah, and I am currently a student of Computer Engineering at Penn State University.

[Here is my resume](https://github.com/rahulsanjay18/rahulsanjay18.github.io/raw/master/Rahul%20Shah%20Resume.docx)

And here is a list of my various projects (in semi-chronological order of start date)! Some of the READMEs that need to be updated are not. Some of the older projects will not have updated READMEs.

* [Calculator](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/Calculator/): Made to try to emulate the functionality of a TI-89 (at the very least, the functions that I or any college student would use)

* [Space-Shooter-FBLA](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/Space-Shooter-FBLA): Yet another competition, this time a game made in Unity. This game, oddly enough, does have many bugs, but the game that I ended up submitting was checked for bugs, and I have no idea where the bug free version of the game is.

* [Minute Math v2](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/MinuteMathGame): An extension on the first version, implementing a level for trigonometry and a better system to evaluate all equations

* [Minute Math v1](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/Minute-Math): For the Congressional App Challenge I made a desktop application that tests you on how fast a person can do fast mathematics

* [CheckersCMDln](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/CheckersCMDln): A (mostly) working checkers game that works in the command line

* Cortex: Created for a competition, where I used JavaFx to create a Desktop Application. Cannot show the code, because I ended up wining the competition (7th in nation). Sorry!

* [arduinoCalculator](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/arduinoCalculator): A four function arduino calculator. Made for a project I did in TinkerCAD. Was mostly to explore the arduino a little.

* [Trivia Game](https://rahulsanjay18.github.io/triviaGame): an iOS project I did in tenth grade as my final project
